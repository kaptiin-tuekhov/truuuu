TrueVault API testin

npm install if you want to run stuff, though if you run fileUpload.js TrueVault will probably respond with an error since the docs are already there

I used an HTTP client I like called [request] (https://github.com/request/request "request") and a [promisified version of fs.ReadFile()] (https://github.com/shinnn/fs-readfile-promise), that's all.
